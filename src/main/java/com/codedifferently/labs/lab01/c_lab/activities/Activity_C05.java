    //Todo: Consider you are asked to decode a secret message. The coded message is in numbers and each number stands for a specific letter.
    // You discover enough of the secret code to decode the current message. So far, you know:
    // • 1 represents “D"
    // • 2 represents “W”
    // • 3 represents “E”
    // • 4 represents “L”
    // • 5 represents “H”
    // • 6 represents “O”
    // • 7 represents “R”
    // Write a program that prompts the user for 10 numbers, one at a time, and prints out the decoded message.
    // If the user enters a number that is not one of those already deciphered, prompt him/her for a new number.
    // Test your code with the following input: 5 3 4 4 6 2 6 7 4 1
